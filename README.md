### OptiCPU üîß

OptiCPU is an advanced utility crafted to continuously optimize system resources, with a primary focus on enhancing CPU usage efficiency, on Linux-based operating systems. The project aims to provide users with a comprehensive toolset to dynamically manage CPU resources, fine-tune system parameters, and adaptively adjust system settings to maintain optimal performance under varying workloads. By employing sophisticated algorithms and real-time monitoring techniques, OptiCPU intelligently adjusts CPU frequency, process priorities, memory management settings, disk I/O configurations, and network parameters to ensure efficient resource utilization while minimizing system overhead. Whether you're operating on older hardware with limited resources or managing high-performance systems, OptiCPU offers a versatile solution to enhance system responsiveness and overall performance, providing a seamless computing experience for users across diverse environments.

[![OptiCPU Philosophy](https://img.shields.io/badge/OptiCPU-Philosophy-green)](https://github.com/OptiCPU)


In today's fast-paced technological landscape, older hardware often struggles to keep up with the demands of modern software. Many users still rely on aging computers that may not have the resources to smoothly run the latest operating systems and applications. Recognizing this challenge, my goal is to provide a solution tailored to such older hardware, particularly those running Linux, with a preference for Arch Linux due to its lightweight and customizable nature.

The idea is to develop a suite of optimization tools that enhance the performance of these older systems, allowing them to run more efficiently and effectively. By focusing on optimizing resource usage, such as CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network activity, we aim to breathe new life into these aging machines.

The key philosophy behind this project is to leverage the flexibility and versatility of Linux, particularly Arch Linux, to create a tailored optimization solution. This involves fine-tuning system settings, adjusting resource allocation, and implementing intelligent monitoring mechanisms to dynamically adapt to changing workload demands.

By empowering users with the ability to optimize their systems, we enable them to extend the lifespan of their hardware, reduce electronic waste, and continue to benefit from the many advantages of Linux computing. Ultimately, this initiative aligns with the principles of sustainability, accessibility, and empowerment, ensuring that even older hardware can thrive in today's digital ecosystem.

#### In this code

- `adjust_cpu_parameters()` Function:
  - Adjusts CPU parameters by setting the CPU frequency governor to "performance" using the `cpupower frequency-set -g performance` command with superuser privileges.

- `optimize_cpu()` Function:
  - Sets the priority of the process to optimize CPU usage by calling `setpriority(PRIO_PROCESS, 0, -10)`.

- `optimize_memory()` Function:
  - Monitors available memory and swap usage to optimize memory usage. It may adjust memory settings if memory usage exceeds a defined threshold.

- `optimize_disk_io()` Function:
  - Monitors disk I/O activity using the `iostat` command and adjusts disk scheduler settings if disk utilization is high.

- `optimize_network()` Function:
  - Monitors network activity using the `sar` command and adjusts network settings if network utilization is high.

- `optimize_system()` Function:
  - Calls all optimization functions (`optimize_cpu()`, `optimize_memory()`, `optimize_disk_io()`, `optimize_network()`) to continuously optimize system resources. This function is executed in a loop to repeatedly optimize the system.

#### Installation
#### Via AUR using YAY

[![OptiCPU](https://img.shields.io/badge/OptiCPU-green)](#)

[![AUR](https://img.shields.io/aur/version/opticpu)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/opticpu)

<!-- 
[![AUR](https://img.shields.io/aur/version/opticpu.svg)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/opticpu)
-->

https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/opticpu

OptiCPU is available on AUR (Arch User Repository), and it can be installed using the `yay` package manager. Follow the steps below to install it:

1. Make sure you have `yay` installed. If not, you can install it with the following command:
   
   ```
   sudo pacman -S yay
   ```
   
   Once yay is installed, you can install by running the following command:
   
   ```
   yay -S opticpu
   ```

This command will automatically fetch the package from AUR and handle the installation process for you.
Run it with the command opticpu.

<sub>After to install it with yay, install it as a service with -sudo-.</sub>

#

#### Bash Installer üöÄ for Linux

[![Bash Installer Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bash%20Installer%20Version-Available-brightgreen)](#)

#### To Install it: 

To install it, simply run the installer script available [here](https://github.com/felipealfonsog/OptiCPU/raw/main/installer.sh).

Or just Copy - Paste in your terminal and use -curl- to start downloading the installer:

   ```
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felipealfonsog/OptiCPU/main/installer.sh
   ```

If you want to use -wget- just copy/paste this line:

   ```
   wget https://github.com/felipealfonsog/OptiCPU/raw/main/installer.sh
   ```

   On macOS to download - wget - just install it with Homebrew:

   brew install wget
   ```

<sub>After to install it with yay, install it as a service with -sudo-.</sub>

#### Important note when installing:

If you encounter issues executing the file in the terminal, like this message "-bash: ./installer.sh: Permission denied", follow these simple steps to fix it:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where the installer script is located using the `cd` command.
3. Run the following command to grant execute permission to the installer script:

   ```
   chmod +x installer.sh
   ```
   
4. Now you can run the installer without any problems.

   ```
   ./installer.sh
   ```
   NOTE: The script will ask for -sudo permissions-. Just simply type in Linux your -sudo- password.

Now type 'opticpu' in the terminal and enjoy using it! üòäüöÄ
