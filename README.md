### OptiCPU
OptiCPU is an advanced utility crafted to continuously optimize system resources, with a primary focus on enhancing CPU usage efficiency, on Linux-based operating systems. The project aims to provide users with a comprehensive toolset to dynamically manage CPU resources, fine-tune system parameters, and adaptively adjust system settings to maintain optimal performance under varying workloads. By employing sophisticated algorithms and real-time monitoring techniques, OptiCPU intelligently adjusts CPU frequency, process priorities, memory management settings, disk I/O configurations, and network parameters to ensure efficient resource utilization while minimizing system overhead. Whether you're operating on older hardware with limited resources or managing high-performance systems, OptiCPU offers a versatile solution to enhance system responsiveness and overall performance, providing a seamless computing experience for users across diverse environments.


<sub>* This is currently an experimental phase where the primary focus is on making the system functional and establishing a practical and logical pathway that aligns with both my vision and the project's goals. It might contain errors, bugs, etc. Many other non-core elements of the project are considered secondary.</sub>

#### In this code

- The optimize_cpu function monitors the system load using the uptime command and adjusts the CPU frequency accordingly.
- The optimize_memory function checks the amount of used memory and adjusts the swappiness parameter if memory usage is high.
- The optimize_disk_io function monitors disk I/O activity using the iostat command and adjusts the disk scheduler if disk utilization is high.
- The optimize_network function monitors network activity using the sar command and adjusts the netdev_max_backlog parameter if network utilization is high.
- All these functions are called within the optimize_system function, which is executed in a loop to continuously optimize the system resources.

#### Installation
#### Via AUR using YAY

[![OptiCPU](https://img.shields.io/badge/OptiCPU-EE6352)](#)

[![AUR](https://img.shields.io/aur/version/opticpu)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/opticpu)

<!-- 
[![AUR](https://img.shields.io/aur/version/opticpu.svg)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/opticpu)
-->

https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/opticpu

OpyiCPU is available on AUR (Arch User Repository), and it can be installed using the `yay` package manager. Follow the steps below to install it:

1. Make sure you have `yay` installed. If not, you can install it with the following command:
   
   ```
   sudo pacman -S yay
   ```
   
   Once yay is installed, you can install by running the following command:
   
   ```
   yay -S opticpu
   ```

This command will automatically fetch the package from AUR and handle the installation process for you.
Run it with the command opticpu.

#### Bash Installer üöÄ for Linux

[![Bash Installer Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bash%20Installer%20Version-Available-brightgreen)](#)

#### To Install it: 

To install it, simply run the installer script available [here](https://github.com/felipealfonsog/OptiCPU/raw/main/installer.sh).

Or just Copy - Paste in your terminal and use -curl- to start downloading the installer:

   ```
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felipealfonsog/OptiCPU/main/installer.sh
   ```

If you want to use -wget- just copy/paste this line:

   ```
   wget https://github.com/felipealfonsog/OptiCPU/raw/main/installer.sh
   ```

   On macOS to download - wget - just install it with Homebrew:

   ```
   brew install wget
   ```

#### Important note when installing:

If you encounter issues executing the file in the terminal, like this message "-bash: ./installer.sh: Permission denied", follow these simple steps to fix it:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where the installer script is located using the `cd` command.
3. Run the following command to grant execute permission to the installer script:

   ```
   chmod +x installer.sh
   ```
   
4. Now you can run the installer without any problems.

   ```
   ./installer.sh
   ```
   NOTE: The script will ask for -sudo permissions-. Just simply type in macOS your macOS user password, and in Linux your -sudo- password.

Now type 'opticpu' in the terminal and enjoy using it! üòäüöÄ


Feel free to reach out if you need any further assistance!

#### Updating with the script: 

If you want to update the program in your system, download the bash and re-run the script:

   ```
   ./installer.sh
   ```
Please note that if you encounter any issues or have suggestions, feel free to raise an issue on the [OptiCPU repository](https://github.com/felipealfonsog/OptiCPU/issues). Your feedback is invaluable!
